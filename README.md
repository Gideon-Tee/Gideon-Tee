- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gideon Tettehfio.
- Well, from a distance, you may call me unsociable, nerdy and even maybe unfriendly. But -
- Hold on a second, before you say that, why don't you get a little closer
- You'll realise how fun and welcoming I actually amðŸ˜Š.
- I love to code and I spend most of my time doing just that.
- You know that feeling when you finally get that piece to work after a thousand shouts at the monitor, I love that feeling.
- I play video games and treat myself a good sleep when I take time off my desk.
- Now, to business:
- I develop android applications with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose
- I employ html, css, javascript, python-django, sql, Express Js in web development
- I want to be a full stack software engineer ranging from web and mobile applications to content management systems and databases and operating systems.
- Iâ€™m currently a software engineering student at ALX and a Computer science student at KNUST

- You probably may be having a long busy day... I have a little joke for you; smile to release some stress --
- ``when you bend your ear closer to the Unix shell, you hear the C ðŸ¤£`` --cliche, I know.
